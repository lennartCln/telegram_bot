## Telegram Bot 
This is a simple Telegram bot running on AWS Lambda with API Gateway. The bot just responses parrotlike to any message it gets and can easily be extended. 


The code running on Lambda is stored in 'lambda_function'. The scripts in the directory 'deployment' make it possible to easily update the code on Lambda.
